Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
This repository contains the source code and data for the Lead-Scoring-Case-Study project. The objective of this project is to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads. The lead score can be used by the company to target potential leads and improve their lead conversion rate.
